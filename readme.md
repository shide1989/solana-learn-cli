### Solana Learning CLI

A CLI I created to learn how to work with Solana, while following the [SolDev course](https://www.soldev.app/course).

## Installation

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

```

## usage

```bash
# Transfer 0.001 SOL to a wallet
pnpm exec esrun index.ts transfer 0.001 6hjq5Wm...

# Airdrop 0.001 SOL to your wallet
pnpm exec esrun index.ts airdrop 0.001
```

## Learning

Follow the [SolDev course](https://www.soldev.app/course) and modify the code as you wish.
